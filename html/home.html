    <h2>Homemade Pizza & Pizza Dough</h2>
<h3> Pre-Bake Dough, if cooking pizza in the oven. If you’re baking the pizza in the oven, whether on a pizza stone or not, I always pre-bake the dough for 4-5 minutes before adding toppings, to make sure the pizza dough cooks crisp on the outside and soft and airy in the middle. Once you add the Pizza Sauce and toppings, return it to the oven to finish baking.
The Flour! I call for bread flour, but all-purpose flour works perfectly well for this recipe. If you’d like to use whole wheat flour, check out my Wheat Pizza Crust Recipe!
Flavor the dough, if you’d like: This is a great basic pizza dough recipe, but you can spice it up to make it more flavorful by adding a few dashes of garlic powder, dried basil, and oregano. </h3>

<h2> Homemade Pasta </h2>
<h3>You only need 4 ingredients to make delicious fresh pasta at home, and there’s a good chance you have all of them on hand already:

All-purpose flour – In the past, I thought you needed 00 flour or semolina flour to make great fresh pasta, but this homemade pasta recipe proved me wrong. In it, regular all-purpose flour yields chewy, bouncy noodles every time.
Eggs – The key ingredient for adding richness and moisture to the dough!
Olive oil – Along with the eggs, a splash of olive oil moistens the dough and helps it come together.
Salt – Add it to the dough and the pasta water for the best flavor.</h3>

<h2> Homemade Spicy Chicken Biryani</h2>

<h3> Chicken Biryani or Murgh Biryani, is a classic Indian dish that has captured the hearts and taste buds of food lovers around the world. The recipe typically calls for a combination of aromatic spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, and cinnamon, which are blended together to create a unique and flavourful spice blend. The chicken is marinated in this spice mix, which infuses the meat with its rich and complex flavours. The rice used in Biryani is equally important, with long-grain basmati rice being the preferred variety due to its light and fluffy texture that pairs perfectly with the spiced chicken.

To prepare chicken Biryani, the chicken is first cooked in a pot with a variety of aromatic ingredients such as onions, garlic, and ginger. Once the chicken is cooked through, it is layered on top of the rice in a large pot or Dutch oven, and the whole thing is baked in the oven or cooked on the stovetop until the rice is perfectly cooked and the flavors have melded together. The final result is a flavorful and aromatic dish that is sure to impress even the most discerning foodies.</h3>

To prepare this easy paneer recipe, take a pan and melt ghee in it. Once the ghee is melted, add ginger garlic paste and saute these ingredients for half a minute. Then add tomato puree to it.
