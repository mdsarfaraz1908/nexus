Allrecipes Magazine
The food industry's first large-scale digital-to-print brand extension, Allrecipes magazine launched in 2013. Now published six times a year, it reaches an audience of nearly 9 million. The magazine serves up a seasonal slice of recipes and real-cook wisdom from Allrecipes.com — along with the best of what's new from the greater food and cooking community (emerging trends, entertaining ideas, new products, and more). We aim for a mix of approachable inspiration and down-to-earth service in every issue.

A majority of the recipes in Allrecipes magazine start with creations shared by home cooks on Allrecipes.com. All are tested, tasted, refined, edited, and professionally photographed before they appear in the magazine. Our editors and contributors also research and write about entertaining, diverse cuisines, Allrecipes Allstars and other fascinating cooks, kitchen decor and organization, cooking gadgets and gear, culinary travel, health, special diets, nutrition, parenting, and pets. We incorporate the best advice from editors, testers, and the cooking community to make good recipes better, great recipes easier, and every day a little more delicious. Sign up for a subscription now.

The Allrecipes Community
The heart of Allrecipes is our community of home cooks who share their beloved family recipes, create new recipes, and photograph, rate, and review each other's recipes. Each week, more than 15 million registered members add more than 2,000 recipe ratings, 800 new recipe photos, and almost 200 new recipes to the site. And every minute of every day, 27 people are saving recipes they love or want to try later.

Community Guidelines
We moderate every review and photograph added to a recipe. When leaving reviews, we ask that you remember that a fellow Allrecipes community member has shared their recipe with you. Constructive feedback is always welcome, but rude, mean, disrespectful, or spammy comments are not welcome and will not be approved.</h3>
